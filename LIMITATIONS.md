# Limitations

For now, some parts of this bootstrap module are non functinonal or barely.

## Database

For now the module doesn't demonstrate the database integration within centeon

## Menu

The documentation regarding the definition of how to integrate menus is small and needs explicitation (menu ids, categories, etc)

## React Front

Some parts of the Front are malfunctionning, most likely due to some difficulties to use components from the @ui library.

More specifically the Service listing page create an infinite scroll page and refreshes for every fetch or new data (when changing page or limits)
